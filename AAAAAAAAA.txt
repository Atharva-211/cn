To find a IP address range for each subnet 
1. The given IP address 221.56.64.0 refers to class C. 

2. The number of 1s in the default mask is 24 in class C. 

3. The requirement is five subnets. This number should be 
	within the range of power of 2 which comes out to be 
	23 =8. There should be 3 more 1 in the subnet mask.

4. The total no of 1s in the subnet mask is 24 + 3 = 27 

5. The total no of 0s in the address is 32 â€“ 27 =5, where 
	32 are the total number of IP address bits and 27 is 
	the total number of 1s in the address as given in step 4. 

6. The subnet mask in binary notation is denoted 
	as : 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000 
	or 255.255.255.224 in decimal form. 
7. A number of subnets that can be actually implemented are 8. 

8. The number of addresses in each subnet is 25= 32. Out of which 
	25-2=30 host addresses are available in each subnet. The address 
	221.56.64.0 is used as network address and 221.56.64.31 is used 
	as broadcast address. So, the hosts range 
	from 221.56.64.1 to 221.56.64.30
